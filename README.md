Secure Unbreakable Password Generator - Assignment Submission

## Password Generator - Generating Strong Passwords

Hello, evaluators! ðŸŒŸ 

I'm thrilled to demonstrate my submission for the JavaScript: I've named it (SUP) Secure Unbreakable Password. Let's go!

## Task Description - Ensuring Secure Passwords

For this assignment, I modified the starter code to create a web application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on their selected criteria. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## User Story - Creating Strong Passwords

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I wanted to create a strong password that meets certain criteria to provide greater security. By using this password generator, I can easily generate a random password that fulfills my requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria - Generating Passwords Effectively

To meet the acceptance criteria and ensure a robust solution, the password generator application adheres to the following specifications:

1. **Generating Password:** Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user is presented with a series of prompts to specify the password criteria.

2. **Password Criteria:** The prompts allow the user to select the criteria they want to include in the password, such as lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

3. **Password Length:** The user is prompted to choose a password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

4. **Input Validation:** The user's input is validated to ensure the selected criteria and length are valid. At least one character type must be selected.

5. **Password Generation:** Once all prompts are answered and the input is validated, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

6. **Password Display:** The generated password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page, providing the user with their new secure password.
